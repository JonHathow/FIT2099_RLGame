This will be done in each member's own time until the deadline. Each person's work will be reviewed by other members of the group, to ensure that it is complete and up to date.
One interesting feature in one of the 4 requirements will be used to create a sequence diagram out of it.
For Group Tasks, members will meet up and collaborate, working together to complete the groups tasks of the requirements.
